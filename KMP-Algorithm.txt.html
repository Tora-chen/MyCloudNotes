KMP Algorithm for Pattern Seaching<br>Pattern: 模式<br>Given a text txt[0...N-1] and a pattern pat[0...M-1], write a
function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all<br>occurrences of pat[] in txt[].You may assume that
N&gt;M.<br>Occurrence: 出现<br>Assume: 假定<br><br>Examples:<br>Input: txt[] = &quot;THIS IS A TEST TEXT&quot;, pat[] =
&quot;TEST&quot;<br>Output: Pattern found at index 10<br>Input: txt[] = &quot;AABAACAADAABAABA&quot;<br>pat[] =
&quot;AABA&quot;<br>Output: Pattern found at index 0, Pattern found at index 9, Pattern found at index 12<br><br>Pattern
searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in a notepad/word file
or<br>browser or database, pattern-searching algorithms are used to show the search results.<br><br>We have discussed
the Naive pattern-searching algorithm in the previous post. The worst case complexity of the Naive<br>algorithm is
O(m(n-m+1)). The time complexity of the KMP algorithm is O(n+m) in the worst case.<br>Discuss: 讨论<br>Naive:

matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having the same sub-patterns appearing more than once in<br>the
pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst-case complexity to O(n+m).<br>Degenerating: 退化。<br>Generating:

matches), we already know some of<br>the characters in the text of the next window. We take advantage of this
information to avoid matching the characters<br>that we know will anyway match.<br>Whenever: 每当。<br>Detect:

with fourth<br>character of current window of text to decide whether current window matches or not. Since we know first
three<br>characters will anyway match, we skipped matching first three characters.<br>Optimization: 优化。<br>Current:

characters to be skipped. To know this, we<br>pre-process pattern and prepare an integer array lps[] that tells us the
count of characters to be skipped.<br>Arise: 产生。<br>Explanation: 解释。<br><br>Preprocessing Overview:<br>• KMP algorithm
preprocesses pat[] and constructs an auxiliary lps[] of size m (same as the size of the pattern) which<br>is used to
skip characters while matching.<br>• Name lps indicates the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix. A proper
prefix is a prefix with a whole string<br>not allowed.<br>Auxiliary: 辅助的。
